** XBL Specific **

- test binding removal

- code in a binding document must be executed in the context of that binding document

- templates
	- simple ( no content element)
	- standard

- styles in binding documents

- check XBL feature strings


** Generic **

- Test & Demos

- Initialization options

- getters and setters if possible


** XBL Specification Queries **

- Processing Instructions in HTML (as opposed to XML) aren't detected in many browsers.
How about <link rel="bindings" type="text/xml" href="binding.xml" /> ?

- xbl trees aren't valid in HTML.
How about <style type="application/xml"><xbl>...</xbl></style> ?

- It should be possible for methods from XBL bindings to override native methods of bound elements.

- It would be useful to have something like HTC's oncontentready and ondocumentready.
One solution would be element.onsubtreemodified and document.onprogress events during document load.

- It seems illogical to have an xblBindingAttached, but not xblBindingDetached.

- Does ElementXBL.addBinding(url) add the binding if it is already present?

- Shouldn't there be a ElementXBL.getBinding(url)?

- Shouldn't @extends be @base-binding? Confusion with ES4 class model.

- What does 'Anything else ("modifier")' mean?

- The relationship between external and internal objects and the implementation prototype seems wrong.

- binding methods starting with xbl shouldn't be on the public object or available from the bound-element.
